Add an “Invite friends” flow to this app, so users can invite people who are NOT yet on the app.

The flow should live inside the “Find Friends / Add Friend” screen and match the same pastel, rounded visual style.

1) Entry card on Find Friends screen:
- Under the search bar and filters, add a wide rounded card.
- Text:
    • Title: “Invite friends who aren’t on the app yet”
    • Subtitle: “Send them a link or SMS so they can join.”
- Card has a small right arrow icon.
- Tapping the card opens an “Invite Friends” bottom sheet.

2) Invite Friends bottom sheet:
- Appears from the bottom with rounded top corners and a light shadow.
- Title: “Invite Friends”
- Subtitle: “Choose how you want to invite them.”
- Two large rounded options (stacked vertically):

   a) “Invite by link”
      - Icon: link or share symbol on the left.
      - Inside this row, when expanded, show:
          • A non-editable text field with a sample invite link
              (e.g. https://app.example.com/invite/ABC123)
          • Buttons:
              - “Copy link”
              - “Share…” (for system share sheet)

   b) “Invite by phone”
      - Icon: phone or SMS bubble.
      - When expanded, show:
          • Text field with label: “Phone number”
          • Placeholder: “e.g. +1 555 123 4567”
          • Primary gradient button: “Send SMS invite”

- Only one section (link or phone) can be expanded at a time, accordion-style.

3) Confirmation states:
- After “Copy link”: show a small toast at the bottom:
    “Invite link copied to clipboard.”
- After “Send SMS invite”: show a toast:
    “Invite sent. Your friend will get a link to join.”

4) Style:
- Use the same pastel background as other screens (light purple/blue gradient).
- All cards and buttons with fully rounded corners and soft shadows.
- Icons should be simple line icons matching the rest of the app.
- Text is friendly, short, and clear.

Keep the entire experience feeling like a natural extension of the existing Friends Map / Connections design.
