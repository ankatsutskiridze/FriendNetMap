You are an expert full-stack engineer.  
My Friends Map app now has two ways to create connections:

1. Direct friend requests (type = "friend")
2. Introductions via a connector (type = "introduction")

After a friend request is approved, a connection is created and appears on both users’ maps.  
However, on the **Connections** screen the text is wrong: it always shows messages like:
- "X was introduced to you via someone"
- "You requested an intro to Y via someone"

This is incorrect for normal friend connections.  
I want the UI text on the Connections list to depend on the connection type and on who the current user is.

Please do the following:

1. In the data model, make sure each connection has:
   - type: "friend" | "introduction"
   - userAId and userBId (the two people connected)
   - optional connectorId (only for introductions, null for friends)

2. In the Connections screen component:
   - When rendering each connection item, determine:
     - const isFriend = connection.type === "friend"
     - const isIntro  = connection.type === "introduction"
     - const isUserA  = connection.userAId === currentUser.id
     - const otherUser = isUserA ? connection.userB : connection.userA

3. For **friend** connections:
   - If currentUser is userA or userB, show:
       title: otherUser.name
       subtitle:
         - "You and {otherUser.name} are now connected"
           OR if you want slightly different variants:
         - If currentUser sent the original friend request, use:
             "You are now connected with {otherUser.name}"
         - If currentUser approved the friend request, use:
             "{otherUser.name} is now connected with you"
   - Do NOT mention "via someone" here.

4. For **introduction** connections:
   - Use the existing copy, but make it more specific using connectorId:
     - If currentUser is the target:
         "{requesterName} was introduced to you via {connectorName}"
     - If currentUser is the requester:
         "You were introduced to {targetName} via {connectorName}"
     - Optionally, if currentUser is the connector:
         "You introduced {requesterName} to {targetName}"

5. Make sure the History / Connections tabs use this new logic, and that:
   - Friend connections created from friend requests show the new friend text.
   - Introductions still show the “via” text with the real connector’s name.

6. Add a brief comment in the Connections list component explaining that
   the subtitle logic depends on connection.type and the perspective of currentUser.
