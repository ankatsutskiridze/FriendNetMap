You are an expert full-stack engineer.  
My “friend introduction” flow in the Friends Map app is only half implemented.

Current behavior:
- I select three people: requester, target, and connector (“via” person).
- An introduction request is created and delivered ONLY to the connector.
- The connector sees a card like: “Barak wants to meet Pnina via you” with Approve / Decline.
- After the connector approves, the map is updated, but the target person (Pnina) NEVER receives any request.

Desired behavior:
We need TWO stages:

Stage 1 – connector:
- recipientId = connectorId
- Card text: "{requesterName} wants to meet {targetName} via you"
- Status: connectorStatus = "pending" | "approved" | "declined"

Stage 2 – target:
- When the connector approves, we must create a new request for the target:
  - recipientId = targetId
  - requesterId = same requesterId
  - connectorId = same connectorId
  - Card text for the TARGET should be:
    "{requesterName} wants to meet you via {connectorName}"
  - status fields: targetStatus = "pending" | "approved" | "declined"

Please do the following:

1. In the database model for introductions, make sure we clearly store:
   - requesterId (who wants to meet)
   - targetId (who should be met)
   - connectorId (via whom)
   - connectorStatus
   - targetStatus
   - recipientId (who this specific notification is for)

2. Keep the existing connector request logic (Stage 1), but:
   - On APPROVE by the connector:
     - create a second introduction notification whose recipientId = targetId
     - text: "{requesterName} wants to meet you via {connectorName}"
     - targetStatus = "pending"

3. Update the “Requests” screen queries:
   - Received tab: list requests where recipientId == currentUser.id
   - Sent tab: list requests created by currentUser (connectorId or requesterId), whichever is used in the app.

4. Ensure that:
   - Aharon1 sees: "Barak wants to meet Pnina via you"
   - After Aharon1 approves, Pnina sees: "Barak wants to meet you via Aharon1"
   - The map is updated only after Pnina approves, or at least after both approvals if you prefer.

5. Add console.log statements when:
   - an introduction is created for the connector
   - an introduction is created for the target
   so we can verify the correct recipientId values.

6. Explain what was missing (Stage 2 to the target person) and what you changed.
