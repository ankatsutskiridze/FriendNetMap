You are an expert full-stack engineer. I have a logic bug in my “friend introduction” feature.

Current behavior:
- When I send an introduction like:
  "Lior wants to meet Pnina via you"
  the request appears in the inbox (Received tab) of the person who created the introduction,
  instead of the person who is supposed to receive/approve it.

Desired behavior:
- The introduction request should be delivered to the correct target person, not the introducer.
- Example:
  I (the connector) choose:
    requester = Lior
    target = Pnina
  The introduction card should show: "Lior wants to meet Pnina via you"
  and the **request should appear in Pnina’s Received tab**, not in my own.

Please do the following:

1. Find the code that creates/saves an introduction request in the database.
   It probably has fields like: senderId, recipientId, userId, fromUserId, toUserId, connectorId, etc.

2. Add clear names for the three roles:
   - connectorId (the user who initiates the introduction – the “via you” person)
   - requesterId (the friend who wants to meet someone)
   - targetId (the friend who should receive the introduction and approve/decline)

3. Fix the logic when creating the request so that:
   - connectorId = current logged-in user
   - requesterId = the friend selected as “wants to meet”
   - targetId = the friend selected as “via you” (the person who must approve)
   Do NOT set recipientId/targetId to the current user unless the current user is actually the target.

4. Update the queries for the Requests screen:
   - Received tab should show requests where targetId == currentUser.id
   - Sent tab should show requests where connectorId == currentUser.id
   (or requesterId, depending on the UX you prefer, but it must be consistent).

5. Make sure the UI text still renders correctly:
   - “[requesterName] wants to meet [targetName] via you”
   using the three fields (connectorId, requesterId, targetId).

6. Add some console.log/debug logs to verify:
   - which IDs are stored when an introduction is created
   - which IDs are used to filter Received and Sent lists.

7. Explain what was wrong (recipient was set to the connector/current user) and exactly how you fixed it.
