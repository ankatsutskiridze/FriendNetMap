You are an expert full-stack engineer.  
Right now, in my Friends Map app, when I tap the **Add** button on the “Find Friends” screen, it immediately creates a friendship/connection without any confirmation from the other user.  

I want to change this to a proper **friend request** flow with approval.

Please implement the following:

1. Data model:
   - Use the existing requests system or create a `friendRequests` table.
   - Fields should include at least:
     - id
     - fromUserId  (who sends the request)
     - toUserId    (who receives the request)
     - status: "pending" | "approved" | "declined"
     - createdAt
   - If there is already a generic `requests` table (used for introductions), add a `type` field:
     - type: "friend" | "introduction"
     and reuse it for friend requests.

2. “Add” button behavior on Find Friends:
   - When the current user taps **Add** on a person:
     - Do NOT create a connection directly.
     - Instead, create a friend request with:
       - fromUserId = currentUser.id
       - toUserId = selectedUser.id
       - type = "friend"
       - status = "pending".
   - Update the UI so the button changes to a disabled “Pending” state for that user.

3. Requests screen:
   - In the **Requests → Received** tab, show friend requests where:
       toUserId === currentUser.id AND type === "friend".
   - Each item should say something like:
       "{fromUserName} wants to connect with you"
     and show **Approve** / **Decline** buttons.

4. Approve / Decline logic:
   - On Approve:
     - Update the request status to "approved".
     - Create an entry in the connections/friendships table (or whatever structure the map uses) linking both users.
     - Ensure the Friends Map updates so both users appear connected.
   - On Decline:
     - Update status to "declined".
     - Do not create a connection.

5. Sent tab:
   - In **Requests → Sent**, show friend requests where:
       fromUserId === currentUser.id AND type === "friend",
     with their current status (pending / approved / declined).

6. Make sure:
   - A user cannot send duplicate friend requests if one is already pending or approved.
   - If a friendship already exists, the Add button should show “Friend” instead of Add.

7. Finally, explain in comments or a short note what changed compared to the old behavior (direct connection vs. request + approval).
