Redesign the “Add Friend” flow. 
I do NOT want a form to manually create a new contact. 
Instead, I want to add an existing user of the app as my friend.

Create a new screen called “Find Friends” with this behavior and layout:

1. Entry point:
   - When the user taps “Add Friend” in the bottom navigation or Connections tab,
     open the “Find Friends” screen instead of the manual form.

2. Top search bar:
   - Full-width rounded search field at the top.
   - Placeholder: “Search people by name…”
   - Include a search icon on the left.

3. Suggested users list:
   - Below the search bar, show a vertical list of existing app users.
   - Each row should include:
       • Circular avatar
       • Full name
       • Small subtitle line with mutual friends, e.g. “5 mutual friends”
       • On the right: a small rounded button:
            - If not connected yet → label: “Add”
            - If a request was already sent → label: “Requested”
   - The list should scroll.

4. Add action:
   - When the user taps the “Add” button:
       • Brief visual feedback (button changes to “Added” with a checkmark).
       • This person should now be considered a direct friend of the current user.
       • In the Map screen, their bubble should appear in the first ring around “You”
         using the same style as other direct friends.

5. Mini-profile:
   - Tapping anywhere on a user row (not the Add button) opens the existing mini-profile
     bottom sheet for that user, with the option “Request introduction” if relevant.

6. Optional filters:
   - Under the search bar, add small filter chips:
        • “All”
        • “Friends of friends”
        • “People you may know”
   - Selected filter uses the primary purple color.

Visual style:
- Use the same pastel gradients, rounded cards, and typography as the Friends Map,
  Requests, and Connections screens.
- The screen should feel like a clean “people finder” inside a social app,
  not like a contact form.
