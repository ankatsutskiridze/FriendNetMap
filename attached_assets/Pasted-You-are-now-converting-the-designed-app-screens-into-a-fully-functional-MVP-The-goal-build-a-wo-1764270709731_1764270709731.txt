You are now converting the designed app screens into a fully functional MVP.  
The goal: build a working social connections app with an interactive friends map, introduction requests, friend management, and invitation system.

Follow these specifications exactly:

========================================
GLOBAL APP STRUCTURE
========================================

• Stack: React + Replit database (or built-in KV DB) + built-in auth (email / social login).
• Routing:
    /map
    /requests
    /connections
    /profile
    /settings
    /find-friends
    /invite
    /user/:id

• Use the UI exactly as designed in Design Mode — keep styles, colors, spacing, shadows, gradients, icons, and component hierarchy.

========================================
AUTH & USER MODEL
========================================
User fields:
- id
- fullName
- photoURL
- location
- about
- instagramHandle
- whatsappNumber
- phoneNumber
- friends: array of user IDs
- pendingRequests: array of request IDs
- sentRequests: array of request IDs

========================================
FRIENDS MAP INTERACTION
========================================
• Load the user's direct friends (1st ring) and second-degree connections (2nd ring).
• Render the bubbles exactly as designed: interactive, tappable, draggable map.
• On bubble tap:
    → Open the user mini-profile bottom sheet.

========================================
INTRODUCTION REQUESTS
========================================
Request structure:
- id
- fromUser
- toUser
- viaUser (the mutual friend)
- message
- status: "pending", "approved", "declined"
- createdAt

Functionality:
• User can send a request via mini-profile.
• If you receive a request:
    - Show in Requests → Received.
    - Buttons: Approve / Decline.
• If approved:
    - Move this new user into Connections list.
    - Open “Connect With [Name]” sheet (WhatsApp / Instagram / Phone).
• If declined:
    - Show “Declined” badge in Sent tab.

========================================
CONNECTIONS SCREEN
========================================
Two tabs:
1. **Connections**
   - Show all approved intros (history + direct adds)
2. **History**
   - Show all past requests with timestamps & status

Include a search bar at the top: “Search connections…”

========================================
FIND FRIENDS (ADD EXISTING USER)
========================================
This replaces the “Add Friend” manual form.

Screen behavior:
• At top: search existing users by name
• Show list:
    - Avatar
    - Full name
    - “X mutual friends”
    - Button on right:
         • “Add” if not a friend yet
         • “Requested” if a request already sent
         • “Added” after adding

When “Add” pressed:
• Add that user to my direct friends list.
• Immediately update the Map view so this user appears in the first ring.

========================================
INVITE FRIENDS (LINK + PHONE)
========================================
Add a card on the Find Friends screen:
“Invite friends who aren’t on the app yet”

On tap → open Invite bottom sheet:

Invite Options:

1) **Invite by link**
    - Generate unique invite link: /invite/<code>
    - Show:
        • read-only link box
        • Copy Link
        • Share…

2) **Invite by phone**
    - Input: phone number
    - On submit: send invite SMS via built-in Replit connector (Twilio or compatible)
    - Show confirmation toast

Invite link behavior:
• If someone opens your invite link → redirect to signup with auto-referral = your user ID.

========================================
PROFILE SCREEN
========================================
Editable fields:
- Photo
- Full name
- Location
- About
- Instagram handle
- WhatsApp number
- Phone

All changes saved live to the DB.

========================================
REQUESTS SCREEN
========================================
Two tabs:
1. Received
    - Card with request info
    - Approve → change status to approved + show Connect sheet
    - Decline → change status to declined
2. Sent
    - Show status badges: Pending / Approved / Declined
    - Approved items have a “Tap to connect” link that opens the contact sheet.

========================================
CONNECT SHEET (after approval)
========================================
Show:
• WhatsApp → deep link to chat
• Instagram → open profile handle
• Phone → trigger tel:+number

Card style must match design.

========================================
SETTINGS
========================================
- Edit profile
- Privacy policy
- Terms
- Logout

========================================
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
========================================
• Use functional components + hooks
• Centralize DB operations in a single service file
• Add controlled state for modals & bottom sheets
• Use transition animations for opening/closing sheets
• Build step-by-step: start with data models → flows → screens → logic → polishing.
