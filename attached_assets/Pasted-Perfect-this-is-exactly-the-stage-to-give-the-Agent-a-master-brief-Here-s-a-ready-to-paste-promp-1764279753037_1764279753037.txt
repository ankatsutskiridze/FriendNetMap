Perfect, this is exactly the stage to give the Agent a “master brief”.
Here’s a ready-to-paste prompt for Replit Agent that tells it to fix & develop everything for Friends Map.

You can copy this whole thing as-is:

📋 Master Prompt for Replit Agent

You already analyzed my “Friends Map” app.
Now I want you to finish the product: replace all mock data with real backend APIs and wire every screen to real data and actions.

Tech assumptions (adopt or adjust to my project):
	•	Frontend: the existing Replit App (React/TypeScript or the current generated stack).
	•	Backend: build a simple REST API inside this Replit project (Node/Express or the default server in server.ts / index.ts).
	•	Use one data store (Replit DB / SQLite / Postgres, whatever is already configured in the project). Just be consistent.
	•	Keep all existing UI and styling. Only change logic / data wiring unless something is obviously broken.

⸻

1. Create / verify backend models & routes

Implement or confirm these core entities and tables/models:
	•	User: id, name, email, username, location, bio, avatarUrl, social links (instagram, whatsapp, facebook), password hash, createdAt, updatedAt.
	•	Friendship: id, userId, friendId, status (accepted, pending), createdAt.
	•	IntroRequest: id, fromUserId, toUserId, viaUserId (the mutual friend), status (pending, approved, declined), message, createdAt, updatedAt.
	•	Activity / History Event: id, userId, type, payload (JSON), createdAt (for the history tab).
	•	Preferences / Settings: id, userId, notificationsEnabled, emailUpdates, introRequestsEnabled, etc.
	•	BlockList (optional for now): id, userId, blockedUserId, createdAt.

Then implement these API routes (adjust file names to our backend structure):

Auth:
	•	POST /api/auth/signup – create user, hash password, return session/token.
	•	POST /api/auth/login – login by email/password.
	•	POST /api/auth/logout – already used by the app, make sure it works with the auth system.
	•	GET /api/auth/me – return currently logged-in user.

Users & Profile:
	•	GET /api/users – search users by name/username (for Find Friends).
	•	GET /api/users/:id – get user by id (for Request Intro page).
	•	PATCH /api/users/:id – update profile, bio, location, avatarUrl, socials, etc. Only allow self.

Friends & Connections:
	•	GET /api/friends – list my friends.
	•	POST /api/friends/:friendId – add friend / accept friend, depending on flow (simplify as needed).

Intro Requests (Introductions):
	•	GET /api/intro-requests/received – intro requests sent to me.
	•	GET /api/intro-requests/sent – intro requests I initiated.
	•	POST /api/intro-requests – create new intro request (from, to, via, message).
	•	POST /api/intro-requests/:id/approve – approve intro.
	•	POST /api/intro-requests/:id/decline – decline intro.

Settings / Preferences:
	•	GET /api/settings – get my preferences.
	•	PATCH /api/settings – update preferences / notification toggles.

It’s OK to keep the data model minimal at first but the above structure should be supported.

2. Connect each frontend page to the backend

Go through every listed page and:
	•	Remove/replace mock data (MOCK_USERS, SUGGESTED_USERS, CONNECTIONS, RECEIVED_REQUESTS, etc.).
	•	Add proper data fetching with loading + error states.
	•	Wire buttons to call the correct API endpoints.
	•	Make sure navigation and state stay in sync with the backend responses.

2.1 Home Page – Friends Map (/)
	•	Replace hardcoded “You” and static friends with real data:
	•	Fetch current user from GET /api/auth/me.
	•	Fetch friends from GET /api/friends.
	•	Compute friends-of-friends from the real friends list or add a dedicated endpoint if needed.
	•	Keep the existing UI, bubble map and mini profile drawer.
	•	Add a loading state while data is fetching and an error state if the API fails.

2.2 Requests Page (/requests)
	•	Replace RECEIVED_REQUESTS and SENT_REQUESTS arrays with:
	•	GET /api/intro-requests/received
	•	GET /api/intro-requests/sent
	•	When user taps Approve or Decline:
	•	Call POST /api/intro-requests/:id/approve or POST /api/intro-requests/:id/decline.
	•	Optimistically update the UI and then refetch the relevant list or update local state.
	•	Preserve the current UI: tabs, cards, status badges, confirmation modals, empty states.
	•	Add pagination support placeholder or simple “load more” if the API supports it.

2.3 Connections Page (/connections)
	•	Replace CONNECTIONS and ACTIVITY_HISTORY mock arrays by:
	•	Fetch friends from GET /api/friends.
	•	Fetch history/activity from a new endpoint, e.g. GET /api/activity or reuse intro requests.
	•	Keep the search and filters, but make them work against the real data.
	•	Add real timestamps to events and display them in the history tab.

2.4 Profile Page (/profile)
	•	Load the logged-in user via GET /api/auth/me instead of the hardcoded “Sara Jenkins”.
	•	Stats (friends, mutuals, etc.) should be calculated from real friends data or via an endpoint like GET /api/friends/stats.
	•	Ensure the Edit button navigates to /profile/edit and that it uses the same user id as the authenticated user.

2.5 Edit Profile Page (/profile/edit)
	•	On mount, fetch the current user (/api/auth/me or GET /api/users/:id) and prefill the form.
	•	When saving, call PATCH /api/users/:id with updated name, location, bio, social links, etc.
	•	Implement:
	•	Form validation (required fields like name, email).
	•	Loading/disabled state on save.
	•	Error handling and success toasts using the existing toast UI.
	•	Hook up the avatar/photo change UI to upload an image:
	•	Either implement real upload (e.g. to a storage bucket) or a simplified solution (base64 / placeholder) depending on what’s available in this Replit template.

2.6 Find Friends Page (/find-friends)
	•	Replace SUGGESTED_USERS with actual API calls:
	•	GET /api/users?search=<query> for search.
	•	Default suggestions from /api/users (excluding current user).
	•	Make the filter chips (All, Friends of Friends) actually filter the real data.
	•	When user taps Add:
	•	Call POST /api/friends/:friendId.
	•	Update local state and ensure the Home Map picks up new friends on next open (or immediately if data is shared via a store).
	•	Keep the invite sheet UI, but wire the SMS/link share actions so they use real data where possible (or leave as TODOs clearly marked in comments).

2.7 Request Intro Page (/request-intro/:id)
	•	Use the :id route param to fetch the target user:
	•	GET /api/users/:id.
	•	When the user sends the intro request:
	•	Call POST /api/intro-requests with { toUserId, message, viaUserId (if applicable) }.
	•	Show loading state and success/error feedback.
	•	On success, redirect back to /requests or show a confirmation state.

2.8 Settings Page (/settings)
	•	Replace local-only toggles with real persisted settings:
	•	On mount: GET /api/settings.
	•	On change: PATCH /api/settings.
	•	Wire these sections:
	•	Help & FAQ – link to a placeholder route or external URL.
	•	Contact Support – open mailto or simple contact form endpoint.
	•	Block List / Privacy Settings – read/write to the blocklist table or a basic blockedUsers field for now.
	•	Change Email – add a simple email change flow using PATCH /api/users/:id (with validation).
	•	Make Delete Account actually call an endpoint like DELETE /api/users/:id, then log the user out and redirect to onboarding. If full deletion is too heavy, at least mark the account as deactivated.
	•	Keep the logout behavior with POST /api/auth/logout.

2.9 Auth / Onboarding Pages (/login, /signup, /onboarding)
	•	Hook up the forms to:
	•	POST /api/auth/signup
	•	POST /api/auth/login
	•	Add form validation, error messages (wrong password, existing email, etc.).
	•	On successful login or signup, redirect to / (Home – Friends Map).
	•	If a session already exists (GET /api/auth/me), skip login and redirect to /.

3. General improvements
	•	Make sure every fetch call has:
	•	Loading state
	•	Error state with user-friendly message
	•	Basic retry where appropriate
	•	Refactor duplicate fetching logic into reusable hooks or utilities if the codebase structure allows it.
	•	Remove all unused mock constants and dead code once the real API connections are working.
	•	Keep TypeScript types in sync with the backend models (User, Friend, IntroRequest, Settings, etc.).

4. What to show me at the end

When you finish:
	•	Summarize all backend endpoints you created or modified.
	•	Summarize for each page:
	•	What changed
	•	What data it now uses
	•	Any TODOs left for future work (e.g., advanced privacy, real image storage, pagination).
	•	Point out any environment variables or secrets I need to set in Replit for this to run.

Start implementing this step-by-step. Make sure the app runs end-to-end with a real signup → login → add friends → send/approve intro → see connections/history flow.

If you want, after it works, send me screenshots or error messages and I’ll help you tweak copy, UX, or fix any bugs.
